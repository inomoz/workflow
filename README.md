- Plan - MITs for day, week. Major first. Do it at the beginning of each day.
- Focus - turn off distractions, clear your space, start! incoming tasks/info - collect! Breathe deeply. Re-focus.
Focus helpers: https://brain.fm/, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPni755-Krg&list=RDcyiEv7khrH0&index=2
- Collect - how (emacs + https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13829075 for mobile setup) + Sync Tool 
- Process - at least once a day, 2 minutes - do it, trash it, delegate it, or put into todo/calendar
Do day/week reviews, check your goals, rest often and enjoy your life =)
